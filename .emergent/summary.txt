The previous AI engineer successfully launched a pediatric clinic management system from MVP to a feature-rich application, utilizing a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. Core functionalities included user authentication, patient profiles, AI-driven CIE-10 diagnosis, appointment scheduling, and a pharmacy module with advanced pricing and intelligent restock. Backend tests passed (48/48), and frontend was visually confirmed. Upon handover, the user provided extensive feedback, outlining numerous bugs and new feature requests, which contradicted the initial no pending tasks assessment. The current agent began addressing these, starting with cosmetic changes and UI enhancements in . A critical authentication token mismatch between the frontend and backend was identified by the , causing write operations to fail silently. The agent was actively debugging this, having located hardcoded tokens in both  and , and was trying to resolve a lint error related to  during an  call. The agent then made a pivot to work on the price calculator functionality.

<product_requirements>
The user, a doctor, requires a comprehensive pediatric clinic website named Clínica Pediátrica Y Farmacia por Dr. Argueta y Dra. Nely. The application needs to ensure all functionalities are synchronized like a Swiss watch. Key requirements and implemented features so far include:
*   **Patient Management**: Capture details, nutritional classification, billing, weight (kg to lb), height (m to cm). **New requests**: Allow multiple CIE-10 codes, auto-fill symptom names, integrate a new comprehensive CIE-10-ES 2024 guide.
*   **Clinical Diagnosis**: AI-driven CIE-10 classification, severity, ability to add new codes.
*   **Appointments**: Two-week calendar, quick-add, minimalist UI, reminders. **New requests**: Fix Quick Appointment not working, add HOY button to display today's appointments with quick access to patient records.
*   **Pharmacy Module**: Medication database, stock tracking, support for different doses, detailed pricing with auto-calculation (Real Cost, Base Price, Public Price, profit). Categories, low stock/expiry alerts, daily sales, zero stock. Quick Sale, AI Intelligent Restock. **New requests**: Fix Add New Product and Price Calculator not working, fix Restock button not working and not auto-filling product names.
*   **Sales & Reports**: Monthly/annual sales (exportable to Excel), product analysis, best customers, AI financial recommendations. **New requests**: Fix sales not registering, ensure Excel export creates a document with monthly/annual metrics in cell format and more cells for annual data.
*   **User Authentication**: Secure login for doctor/pharmacist.
*   **UI/UX**: Intuitive design. **New requests**: Dashboard to reflect real-time updates from other sections (alerts, today's appointments/sales, total patients).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the agent was focused on resolving critical bug fixes and implementing user-requested enhancements. The clinic name was successfully updated in the UI. The agent implemented dashboard auto-refresh, added a HOY button to display today's appointments, and modified patient management to support multiple CIE-10 codes, including associated functions and UI elements in . A new  component was created.

However, a major blocker was identified by the : a critical authentication token mismatch. Specifically, a hardcoded token  was found in  (line 787) and a similar hardcoded token  was found in  (line 3634). This mismatch was causing POST/PUT/DELETE operations to fail silently, leading to dashboard synchronization issues and problems with features like quick appointments or sales. The agent attempted to correct the hardcoded token in  but encountered an ESLint error: , indicating a problem with how  headers were being configured after removing the hardcoded value. The agent was in the process of debugging this specific error to correctly pass authentication headers.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and resolve the ESLint error regarding  being undefined at line 3634 in  to fix the authentication token issue.
