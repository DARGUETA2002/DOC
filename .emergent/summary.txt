<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed a comprehensive pediatric clinic management system, transforming it from an MVP to a feature-rich application. This involved establishing a robust React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack. Core functionalities like user authentication, patient profiles, AI-driven CIE-10 diagnosis, appointment scheduling, and a full-fledged pharmacy module were implemented. Key enhancements included a two-week calendar, a detailed pharmacy pricing calculator with profit guarantees, Quick Appointment, Quick Sale, intelligent AI restock, weight/height unit conversions, and advanced sales reporting with Excel export and AI financial recommendations. The engineer meticulously validated all changes through extensive backend testing (achieving 48/48 passing tests) and visual confirmation of frontend functionalities, ensuring the system is fully functional and all requested features are integrated.

<product_requirements>
The user, a doctor, requires a comprehensive pediatric clinic website with the following functionalities:
*   **Patient Management**: Capture patient details, nutritional classification (BMI-based), billing, with weight converted from kg to lb and height from m to cm.
*   **Clinical Diagnosis**: AI-driven CIE-10 classification from natural language input, including severity, and the ability to add new CIE-10 codes.
*   **Appointments**: A two-week calendar view, quick-add after consultations, minimalist UI, and reminders.
*   **Pharmacy Module**: Medication database with stock tracking (Nuevo Producto name), support for same product with different doses. Detailed pricing (unit cost, tax, purchase scale, discount) with auto-calculation of Real Cost, Base Price, Public Price, and profit margin. Specific categories. Alerts for low stock, expiring products (4 weeks), daily sales, and zero stock. Quick Sale and AI-driven Intelligent Restock.
*   **Sales & Reports**: Exclusive section for monthly/annual sales (exportable to Excel), product analysis, best customers, and monthly AI financial recommendations.
*   **User Authentication**: Secure login for doctor/pharmacist roles.
*   **UI/UX**: Attractive, intuitive design with modern aesthetics and precise AI features.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a comprehensive set of user-requested enhancements. The core CIE-10 classification now uses AI for automatic diagnosis detection, and patient data input fields for weight and height have been converted to lbs and cms, respectively. The pharmacy module has been significantly expanded to include a fully functional and accurate pricing calculator with profit margin guarantees, a Venta Rápida (Quick Sale) feature for fast sales, an AI-driven intelligent restock system, and enhanced low stock/expiry alerts (4 weeks anticipation). The calendar view was extended to show two weeks with a minimalist design and quick-add appointment functionality. A new, exclusive sales reporting dashboard was created, offering monthly/annual sales analysis, product profitability insights, best customer identification, and AI-powered financial recommendations, with a prototype for Excel export. Medication editing functionality was added. All backend changes were validated with comprehensive tests (48/48 passed), and frontend functionality was visually confirmed via screenshots, demonstrating the successful integration and operation of all new features, including the enhanced dashboard and pharmacy views.
