The AI engineer successfully initiated and iteratively developed a pediatric clinic management system, closely following user feedback. Initial efforts focused on establishing the React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack, implementing user authentication with a specific code (1970), and creating core patient profile functionalities. The engineer effectively troubleshooted backend dependencies (bcrypt) and resolved initial frontend display and navigation issues. Subsequent development introduced more complex features like AI-driven CIE-10 diagnosis classification, an appointment calendar, and a sophisticated pharmacy inventory and sales system. The AI successfully integrated the AI-based CIE-10 lookup, fixed associated frontend errors (e.g., ), and made general UI improvements. The current work is centered on refining the calendar's display and fully implementing the detailed pharmacy pricing logic, stock alerts, and doctor-pharmacy communication features as outlined in the latest user requests.

<product_requirements>
The user, a doctor, requires a comprehensive website for a pediatric clinic. The application must support:
*   **Patient Profiles**: Capture full name, date of birth, age, parent's name, address, phone number, symptoms, and clinical signs.
*   **Clinical Diagnosis**: Automatic classification using CIE-10 codes based on clinical diagnosis input (AI-driven), with an added classification for severity (Grave, Moderada, Leve).
*   **Treatment**: Record treatments per appointment, including a feature to filter and view available pharmacy medications to aid prescription decisions.
*   **Lab Analysis**: Document laboratory results when tests are requested.
*   **Nutritional Condition**: Classify patients based on BMI categories: under 16 (desnutrido), 16-24.9 (normal), 25-29.9 (obesidad leve), 30-34.9 (obesidad moderada), and over 35 (mórbida/patógena).
*   **Appointments**: A calendar for weekly scheduling, with the ability to add new appointments quickly after a consultation, and a request for a two-week view. Appointment reminders are also needed.
*   **Billing**: Control and log payment per appointment, integrating this into the patient’s historical record.
*   **Pharmacy Module**:
    *   A database for medications with stock tracking.
    *   Product input details: unit cost (with/without tax), applicable tax, purchase scale (e.g., 10+3), and discount.
    *   Automatic calculations: Real cost, Base price (minimum 25% profit), Public price (maintaining 25% profit after discount), and final profit margin.
    *   Categories: Medicamentos, Cuidado personal y de higiene infantil, Alimentación infantil, Hogar y bienestar, Productos de uso clínico y cuidado, Dermatología pediátrica, and Cosméticos.
    *   Alerts for low stock, expiring products, and sales trends.
*   **User Authentication**: Secure login with a specific code (e.g., 1970) for doctor/pharmacist roles.
*   **UI/UX**: An attractive and intuitive design using modern colors and icons. All automated features should be precise and autonomous with AI.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively resolving a critical frontend error () related to the CIE-10 classification display, which was addressed through modifications in . Concurrently, the backend, , was successfully updated to integrate the AI-powered CIE-10 classification, and a test call for Hidrocefalia confirmed its accurate functioning, returning the correct code and chapter. Furthermore, general UI improvements were being applied via  to meet user expectations for a more attractive design. The AI engineer also processed the user's latest feedback, which explicitly requested expanding the appointment calendar to display two weeks and detailed the comprehensive requirements for the pharmacy system's pricing calculations, alerts, and doctor-pharmacy stock integration. The current state is that the core CIE-10 functionality has been validated, and the engineer is poised to implement the remaining advanced calendar and pharmacy features.
